# About Nand2Tetris

The Nand2Tetris project is an educational initiative aimed at providing a hands-on experience of building a complete computer system, starting from the most basic logic gates (NAND gates) and culminating in a functional computer with an operating system. As part of this project, students are introduced to an assembly language specifically designed for the Nand2Tetris architecture.

The assembler application takes assembly code as input, which is a low-level symbolic representation of machine instructions. It parses the assembly instructions, resolves symbolic labels and addresses, and generates the corresponding binary machine code instructions. This binary code can then be executed by the Nand2Tetris hardware simulator or written to a ROM chip for use in a physical Nand2Tetris computer.

The Nand2Tetris assembler application plays a vital role in bridging the gap between human-readable assembly code and the machine-understandable binary code. It automates the process of translating assembly instructions into their binary equivalents, making it easier for students and developers to work with the Nand2Tetris computer architecture.

Overall, the Nand2Tetris assembler application simplifies the process of converting assembly code into machine code, enabling students and enthusiasts to explore the inner workings of computer systems and gain a deeper understanding of how software and hardware interact.
